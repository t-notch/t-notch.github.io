Let me talk about myself - *yeah I know, github pages are more for code and code than human's blog* - but I would like to put a human touch first for this page and it is always good to know others and let other know you:

1. I'm 30 something and dad of 2 boys born in 2011 and 2015. I am automotive engineer for several years after dropping out from my PhD in robotics. 

2. I enjoy learning, building and creating new things . I believe in future AI, robots, autonomous transportation system, IoT and most of all, power of people who share the same dream for future.

3. If you want to know more about me, there are Facebook and Linkedin in the left side.

4. I use this github page for sharing my experience while learning and building things, and ultimately for my 2 sons. I don't know when they can start run and understand my codes (and if my codes are still executable for the quantum computer they will have in 10 years, 20 years - *who know*), however, they will understand the world that they live in at that moment could be built from the code their dad wrote for their toy robots years ago - *again who knows .!*

5. For school exercise, my first son wrote "lazy" as one of my characters while mom has the best characters in the world. I don't feel bad about that, I always think that "lazy" is part of "creative" - which is nice. - So I'm **LAZY DAD WITH COOL ROBOTS.**
