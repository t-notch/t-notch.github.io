&lt;p&gt;You’ll be tempted to follow the crowd. To not go your own way. Going your own way seems riskier. And sometimes it is. It may cause you to lose some relationships. It may invite criticism and persecution. It may require you to leave some money on the table. Maybe a lot of money.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you’re not here to prevent those things from happening. You’re not here to impress people or to see how much money you can make. You’re here to learn something and to be something special.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what it means to go your own way. It’s about knowing who you are, what you want, and what you’re here to do. You’re not going to be here long. Stop holding back. Put yourself out there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Personal Growth</name></author><category term="blogs" /><category term="mind" /><summary type="html">Let your innerself choose the way, and don’t hesitate to walk it.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Value of Silence</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/the-value-of-silence/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Value of Silence" /><published>2018-09-02T12:18:00+02:00</published><updated>2018-09-02T12:18:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/the-value-of-silence</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/the-value-of-silence/">&lt;p&gt;Most of us don’t like silence, because it forces us to confront ourselves. And sometimes what we find staring back is emptiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re also afraid of silence, because we equate silence with insignificance. We want to be heard and seen. We want to make ourselves relevant. We want tobe somebody in the eyes of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The desire to make ourselves feel relevant can be very strong. But in our questto be heard and noticed and thought well of by others we often drown out ourinner voice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re constantly in search of something we already have. We already have everything we truly need within us. The peace we seek is not out there somewhere. It’s in the here and now, in this moment, within us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to know yourself, turn off the T.V., the radio, the internet and therunning dialogue in your head. Go to a quiet place and spend time alone. This is where you’ll meet yourself. This is where you’ll learn what’s truly important to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While sitting in silence we can hear and see things we otherwise wouldn’t, and our desires become few and simple. We find our inner voice of contentment and realize that we’re already everything we need to be. Silence helps bring us back to a place of rest and clarity within, away from the noise of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guard this space in your schedule. It’s more important than anything you do, because it’s from there that you’ll find the strength, purpose and self-composure to be a better person for yourself and for others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like sleeping, brushing your teeth, eating, going to work and exercise, we need time for silence in our day. We need time in our day to cultivate silence so we can bring it with us into our daily actions and live with a sense of peace, even in the midst of stressful circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Personal Growth</name></author><category term="blogs" /><category term="mind" /><summary type="html">Most of us don’t like silence, because it forces us to confront ourselves.

But even when we’re accepted, we don’t necessarily belong. True happiness has to come from outside of the desire to belong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is happiness in silence and solitude. There is happiness in being thankful for what you have. There is happiness in relationship with God. This isn’t always easy to see. And for those who aren’t used to it, it’s not easy to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of our happiness comes from within. This is especially true after our material needs have been met. If you have everything you need but you’re still unhappy, the unhappiness is likely from a lack of appreciation for what you have and for what’s available to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This lack of appreciation comes mainly from a lack of recognition. Most of the time we don’t recognize how fortune we are, because we’re so used to having everything we need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn to appreciate what you have. Learn to live with less and still be happy. And follow your heart. Not your emotions, but what you know in your heart of hearts is the right thing for you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Personal Growth</name></author><category term="blogs" /><category term="mind" /><summary type="html">A lot of our unhappiness comes from the feeling of not belonging.

Use that time to keep doing your thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes criticism is justified. And sometimes it’s envy, ignorance, or fear. Criticism often comes from not seeing the whole picture. We’re often convinced that we see the whole picture, but usually we see very little.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t expect people who have never done what you do to understand it. Go ahead and continue doing what others have said can’t be done. No matter what you do, there will always be someone who will challenge the validity of your mission and your intent. Don’t be surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even the people closest to you are capable of underestimating you. They may try to keep you where they think you belong. They may even do it as a way of protecting you. They might underestimate you because they underestimate themselves. And since they see you as essentially an extension of themselves, they may not believe you can do better than them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes we need others to talk some sense into us and prevent us from doing something stupid. They will hold you back when you need to be held back. But they will also hold you back when they should be pushing you forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, you have to make your own decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Personal Growth</name></author><category term="blogs" /><category term="mind" /><summary type="html">Don’t waste time trying to win over your detractors.

Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult. We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we are not careful, our colleges will produce a group of close-minded, unscientific, illogical propagandists, consumed with immoral acts. Be careful, “brethren!” Be careful, teachers!&lt;/p&gt;
