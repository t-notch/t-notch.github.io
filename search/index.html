Last week, on the train back home after full day meeting, and mobile phone’s battery was empty, I picked up the newspaper and gave the Sudoku a try. 40 mins and no success (such a loser am I). I thought:  for computer it should be easy. Well, it is true: Peter Norvig even has a blog about it.  there should be an app for that. Yes, a bunch of them. Magic Sudoku is one of the examples. Founder of the company Brad Dwyer even had a blog on how they built the app.  and I can do it myself. - not yet true, I still struggle here and there, but the idea is quite straight forward. And most of the code from computer vision to detect, and segment the ROI, to MNIST training to classify the number and Sudoku solver are available.Here are 2 videos from geaxgx1 showed how he did it.

        "content": "In this essay I tackle the problem of solving every Sudoku puzzle. It turns out to be quite easy (about one page of code for the main idea and two pages for embellishments) using two ideas: constraint propagation and search.Sudoku Notation and Preliminary NotionsFirst we have to agree on some notation. A Sudoku puzzle is a grid of 81 squares; the majority of enthusiasts label the columns 1-9, the rows A-I, and call a collection of nine squares (column, row, or box) a unit and the squares that share a unit the peers. A puzzle leaves some squares blank and fills others with digits, and the whole idea is:  A puzzle is solved if the squares in each unit are filled with a permutation of the digits 1 to 9.That is, no digit can appear twice in a unit, and every digit must appear once. This implies that each square must have a different value from any of its peers. Here are the names of the squares, a typical puzzle, and the solution to the puzzle: A1 A2 A3| A4 A5 A6| A7 A8 A9    4 . . |. . . |8 . 5     4 1 7 |3 6 9 |8 2 5  B1 B2 B3| B4 B5 B6| B7 B8 B9    . 3 . |. . . |. . .     6 3 2 |1 5 8 |9 4 7 C1 C2 C3| C4 C5 C6| C7 C8 C9    . . . |7 . . |. . .     9 5 8 |7 2 4 |3 1 6 ---------+---------+---------    ------+------+------    ------+------+------ D1 D2 D3| D4 D5 D6| D7 D8 D9    . 2 . |. . . |. 6 .     8 2 5 |4 3 7 |1 6 9  E1 E2 E3| E4 E5 E6| E7 E8 E9    . . . |. 8 . |4 . .     7 9 1 |5 8 6 |4 3 2  F1 F2 F3| F4 F5 F6| F7 F8 F9    . . . |. 1 . |. . .     3 4 6 |9 1 2 |7 5 8 ---------+---------+---------    ------+------+------    ------+------+------ G1 G2 G3| G4 G5 G6| G7 G8 G9    . . . |6 . 3 |. 7 .     2 8 9 |6 4 3 |5 7 1  H1 H2 H3| H4 H5 H6| H7 H8 H9    5 . . |2 . . |. . .     5 7 3 |2 9 1 |6 8 4  I1 I2 I3| I4 I5 I6| I7 I8 I9    1 . 4 |. . . |. . .     1 6 4 |8 7 5 |2 9 3 Every square has exactly 3 units and 20 peers. For example, here are the units and peers for the square C2:    A2   |         |                    |         |            A1 A2 A3|         |             B2   |         |                    |         |            B1 B2 B3|         |             C2   |         |            C1 C2 C3| C4 C5 C6| C7 C8 C9   C1 C2 C3|         |         ---------+---------+---------  ---------+---------+---------  ---------+---------+---------    D2   |         |                    |         |                    |         |             E2   |         |                    |         |                    |         |             F2   |         |                    |         |                    |         |         ---------+---------+---------  ---------+---------+---------  ---------+---------+---------    G2   |         |                    |         |                    |         |             H2   |         |                    |         |                    |         |             I2   |         |                    |         |                    |         |         We can implement the notions of units, peers, and squares in the programming languagePython  (2.5 or later) as follows:def cross(A, B):    \"Cross product of elements in A and elements in B.\"    return [a+b for a in A for b in B]digits   = '123456789'rows     = 'ABCDEFGHI'cols     = digitssquares  = cross(rows, cols)unitlist = ([cross(rows, c) for c in cols] +            [cross(r, cols) for r in rows] +            [cross(rs, cs) for rs in ('ABC','DEF','GHI') for cs in ('123','456','789')])units = dict((s, [u for u in unitlist if s in u])              for s in squares)peers = dict((s, set(sum(units[s],[]))-set([s]))             for s in squares)If you are not familiar with some of the features of Python, note that a dict or dictionary is Python’s name for a hash table that maps each key to a value; that these are specified as a sequence of (key, value) tuples; that dict((s, [...]) for s in squares) creates a dictionary which maps each square s to a value that is the list [...]; and that the expression [u for u in unitlist if s in u] means that this value is the list of units u such that the square s is a member of u. So read this assignment statement as “units is a dictionary where each square maps to the list of units that contain the square”. Similarly, read the next assignment statement as “peers is a dictionary where each square s maps to the set of squares formed by the union of the squares in the units of s, but not s itself”.It can’t hurt to throw in some tests (they all pass):def test():    \"A set of unit tests.\"    assert len(squares) == 81    assert len(unitlist) == 27    assert all(len(units[s]) == 3 for s in squares)    assert all(len(peers[s]) == 20 for s in squares)    assert units['C2'] == [['A2', 'B2', 'C2', 'D2', 'E2', 'F2', 'G2', 'H2', 'I2'],                           ['C1', 'C2', 'C3', 'C4', 'C5', 'C6', 'C7', 'C8', 'C9'],                           ['A1', 'A2', 'A3', 'B1', 'B2', 'B3', 'C1', 'C2', 'C3']]    assert peers['C2'] == set(['A2', 'B2', 'D2', 'E2', 'F2', 'G2', 'H2', 'I2',                               'C1', 'C3', 'C4', 'C5', 'C6', 'C7', 'C8', 'C9',                               'A1', 'A3', 'B1', 'B3'])    print 'All tests pass.'Now that we have squares, units, and peers, the next step is to define the Sudoku playing grid. Actually we need two representations: First, a textual format used to specify the initial state of a puzzle; we will reserve the name grid for this. Second, an internal representation of any state of a puzzle, partially solved or complete; this we will call a values collection because it will give all the remaining possible values for each square. For the textual format (grid) we’ll allow a string of characters with 1-9 indicating a digit, and a 0 or period specifying an empty square. All other characters are ignored (including spaces, newlines, dashes, and bars). So each of the following three grid strings represent the same puzzle:\"4.....8.5.3..........7......2.....6.....8.4......1.......6.3.7.5..2.....1.4......\"\"\"\"400000805030000000000700000020000060000080400000010000000603070500200000104000000\"\"\"\"\"\"4 . . |. . . |8 . 5 . 3 . |. . . |. . . . . . |7 . . |. . . ------+------+------. 2 . |. . . |. 6 . . . . |. 8 . |4 . . . . . |. 1 . |. . . ------+------+------. . . |6 . 3 |. 7 . 5 . . |2 . . |. . . 1 . 4 |. . . |. . . \"\"\"Now for values. One might think that a 9 x 9 array would be the obvious data structure. But squares have names like 'A1', not (0,0). Therefore, values will be a dict with squares as keys. The value of each key will be the possible digits for that square: a single digit if it was given as part of the puzzle definition or if we have figured out what it must be, and a collection of several digits if we are still uncertain. This collection of digits could be represented by a Python set or list, but I chose instead to use a string of digits (we’ll see why later). So a grid where A1 is 7 and C7 is empty would be represented as {'A1': '7', 'C7': '123456789', ...}.Here is the code to parse a grid into a values dict:def parse_grid(grid):    \"\"\"Convert grid to a dict of possible values, {square: digits}, or    return False if a contradiction is detected.\"\"\"    ## To start, every square can be any digit; then assign values from the grid.    values = dict((s, digits) for s in squares)    for s,d in grid_values(grid).items():        if d in digits and not assign(values, s, d):            return False ## (Fail if we can't assign d to square s.)    return valuesdef grid_values(grid):    \"Convert grid into a dict of {square: char} with '0' or '.' for empties.\"    chars = [c for c in grid if c in digits or c in '0.']    assert len(chars) == 81    return dict(zip(squares, chars))Constraint PropagationThe function parse_grid calls assign(values, s, d). We could implement this as values[s] = d, but we can do more than just that. Those with experience solving Sudoku puzzles know that there are two important strategies that we can use to make progress towards filling in all the squares:  *(1) If a square has only one possible value, then eliminate that value from the square’s peers. *  (2) If a unit has only one possible place for a value, then put the value there.As an example of strategy (1) if we assign 7 to A1, yielding {'A1': '7', 'A2':'123456789', ...}, we see that A1 has only one value, and thus the 7 can be removed from its peer A2 (and all other peers), giving us {'A1': '7', 'A2': '12345689', ...}. As an example of strategy (2), if it turns out that none of A3 through A9 has a 3 as a possible value, then the 3 must belong in A2, and we can update to {'A1': '7', 'A2':'3', ...}. These updates to A2 may in turn cause further updates to its peers, and the peers of those peers, and so on. This process is called constraint propagation.The function assign(values, s, d) will return the updated values (including the updates from constraint propagation), but if there is a contradiction–if the assignment cannot be made consistently–then assign returns False. For example, if a grid starts with the digits '77...' then when we try to assign the 7 to A2, assign would notice that 7 is not a possibility for A2, because it was eliminated by the peer, A1.It turns out that the fundamental operation is not assigning a value, but rather eliminating one of the possible values for a square, which we implement with eliminate(values, s, d). Once we have eliminate, then assign(values, s, d) can be defined as “eliminate all the values from s except d”.def assign(values, s, d):    \"\"\"Eliminate all the other values (except d) from values[s] and propagate.    Return values, except return False if a contradiction is detected.\"\"\"    other_values = values[s].replace(d, '')    if all(eliminate(values, s, d2) for d2 in other_values):        return values    else:        return Falsedef eliminate(values, s, d):    \"\"\"Eliminate d from values[s]; propagate when values or places &lt;= 2.    Return values, except return False if a contradiction is detected.\"\"\"    if d not in values[s]:        return values ## Already eliminated    values[s] = values[s].replace(d,'')    ## (1) If a square s is reduced to one value d2, then eliminate d2 from the peers.    if len(values[s]) == 0:\treturn False ## Contradiction: removed last value    elif len(values[s]) == 1:        d2 = values[s]        if not all(eliminate(values, s2, d2) for s2 in peers[s]):            return False    ## (2) If a unit u is reduced to only one place for a value d, then put it there.    for u in units[s]:\tdplaces = [s for s in u if d in values[s]]\tif len(dplaces) == 0:\t    return False ## Contradiction: no place for this value\telif len(dplaces) == 1:\t    # d can only be in one place in unit; assign it there            if not assign(values, dplaces[0], d):                return False    return valuesNow before we can go much further, we will need to display a puzzle:def display(values):    \"Display these values as a 2-D grid.\"    width = 1+max(len(values[s]) for s in squares)    line = '+'.join(['-'*(width*3)]*3)    for r in rows:        print ''.join(values[r+c].center(width)+('|' if c in '36' else '')                      for c in cols)        if r in 'CF': print line    printNow we’re ready to go. I picked the first example from a list of easy puzzles from the fine Project Euler Sudoku problem and tried it:&gt;&gt;&gt; grid1 = '003020600900305001001806400008102900700000008006708200002609500800203009005010300'&gt;&gt;&gt; display(parse_grid(grid1))4 8 3 |9 2 1 |6 5 7 9 6 7 |3 4 5 |8 2 1 2 5 1 |8 7 6 |4 9 3 ------+------+------5 4 8 |1 3 2 |9 7 6 7 2 9 |5 6 4 |1 3 8 1 3 6 |7 9 8 |2 4 5 ------+------+------3 7 2 |6 8 9 |5 1 4 8 1 4 |2 5 3 |7 6 9 6 9 5 |4 1 7 |3 8 2 In this case, the puzzle was completely solved by rote application of strategies (1) and (2)! Unfortunately, that will not always be the case. Here is the first example from a list of hard puzzles:&gt;&gt;&gt; grid2 = '4.....8.5.3..........7......2.....6.....8.4......1.......6.3.7.5..2.....1.4......'&gt;&gt;&gt; display(parse_grid(grid2))   4      1679   12679  |  139     2369    269   |   8      1239     5     26789     3    1256789 | 14589   24569   245689 | 12679    1249   124679   2689   15689   125689 |   7     234569  245689 | 12369   12349   123469 ------------------------+------------------------+------------------------  3789     2     15789  |  3459   34579    4579  | 13579     6     13789    3679   15679   15679  |  359      8     25679  |   4     12359   12379   36789     4     56789  |  359      1     25679  | 23579   23589   23789  ------------------------+------------------------+------------------------  289      89     289   |   6      459      3    |  1259     7     12489     5      6789     3    |   2      479      1    |   69     489     4689     1      6789     4    |  589     579     5789  | 23569   23589   23689  In this case, we are still a long way from solving the puzzle–61 squares remain uncertain. What next? We could try to code more sophisticated strategies. For example, the naked twins strategy looks for two squares in the same unit that both have the same two possible digits. Given {'A5': '26', 'A6':'26', ...}, we can conclude that 2 and 6 must be in A5 and A6 (although we don’t know which is where), and we can therefore eliminate 2 and 6 from every other square in the A row unit. We could code that strategy in a few lines by adding an elif len(values[s]) == 2 test to eliminate.Coding up strategies like this is a possible route, but would require hundreds of lines of code (there are dozens of these strategies), and we’d never be sure if we could solve every puzzle.SearchThe other route is to search for a solution: to systematically try all possibilities until we hit one that works. The code for this is less than a dozen lines, but we run another risk: that it might take forever to run. Consider that in the grid2 above, A2 has 4 possibilities (1679) and A3 has 5 possibilities (12679); together that’s 20, and if we keep multiplying, we get 4.62838344192 × 1038 possibilities for the whole puzzle. How can we cope with that? There are two choices.First, we could try a brute force approach. Suppose we have a very efficient program that takes only one instruction to evaluate a position, and that we have access to the next-generation computing technology, let’s say a 10GHz processor with 1024 cores, and let’s say we could afford a million of them, and while we’re shopping, let’s say we also pick up a time machine and go back 13 billion years to the origin of the universe and start our program running. We can then compute that we’d be almost 1% done with this one puzzle by now.The second choice is to somehow process much more than one possibility per machine instruction. That seems impossible, but fortunately it is exactly what constraint propagation does for us. We don’t have to try all 4 × 1038 possibilities because as soon as we try one we immediately eliminate many other possibilities. For example, square H7 of this puzzle has two possibilities, 6 and 9. We can try 9 and quickly see that there is a contradiction. That means we’ve eliminated not just one possibility, but fully half of the 4 × 1038 choices.In fact, it turns out that to solve this particular puzzle we need to look at only 25 possibilities and we only have to explicitly search through 9 of the 61 unfilled squares; constraint propagation does the rest. For the list of 95 hard puzzles, on average we need to consider 64 possibilities per puzzle, and in no case do we have to search more than 16 squares.What is the search algorithm? Simple: first make sure we haven’t already found a solution or a contradiction, and if not, choose one unfilled square and consider all its possible values. One at a time, try assigning the square each value, and searching from the resulting position. In other words, we search for a value d such that we can successfully search for a solution from the result of assigning square s to d. If the search leads to an failed position, go back and consider another value of d. This is a recursivesearch, and we call it a depth-first search because we (recursively) consider all possibilities under values[s] = d before we consider a different value for s.To avoid bookkeeping complications, we create a new copy of values for each recursive call to search. This way each branch of the search tree is independent, and doesn’t confuse another branch. (This is why I chose to implement the set of possible values for a square as a string: I can copy values with values.copy() which is simple and efficient. If I implemented a possibility as a Python set or list I would need to use copy.deepcopy(values), which is less efficient.) The alternative is to keep track of each change to values and undo the change when we hit a dead end. This is known as backtracking search. It makes sense when each step in the search is a single change to a large data structure, but is complicated when each assignment can lead to many other changes via constraint propagation.There are two choices we have to make in implementing the search: variable ordering (which square do we try first?) and value ordering (which digit do we try first for the square?). For variable ordering, we will use a common heuristic called minimum remaining values, which means that we choose the (or one of the) square with the minimum number of possible values. Why? Consider grid2 above. Suppose we chose B3 first. It has 7 possibilities (1256789), so we’d expect to guess wrong with probability 6/7. If instead we chose G2, which only has 2 possibilities (89), we’d expect to be wrong with probability only 1/2. Thus we choose the square with the fewest possibilities and the best chance of guessing right. For value ordering we won’t do anything special; we’ll consider the digits in numeric order.Now we’re ready to define the solve function in terms of the search function:def solve(grid): return search(parse_grid(grid))def search(values):    \"Using depth-first search and propagation, try all possible values.\"    if values is False:        return False ## Failed earlier    if all(len(values[s]) == 1 for s in squares):         return values ## Solved!    ## Chose the unfilled square s with the fewest possibilities    n,s = min((len(values[s]), s) for s in squares if len(values[s]) &gt; 1)    return some(search(assign(values.copy(), s, d)) \t\tfor d in values[s])def some(seq):    \"Return some element of seq that is true.\"    for e in seq:        if e: return e    return FalseThat’s it! We’re done; it only took one page of code, and we can now solve any Sudoku puzzle.ResultsYou can view the complete program. Below is the output from running the program at the command line; it solves the two files of 50 easy and 95 hard puzzles (see also the 95 solutions), eleven puzzles I found under a search for [hardest sudoku], and a selection of random puzzles:% python sudo.pyAll tests pass.Solved 50 of 50 easy puzzles (avg 0.01 secs (86 Hz), max 0.03 secs).Solved 95 of 95 hard puzzles (avg 0.04 secs (24 Hz), max 0.18 secs).Solved 11 of 11 hardest puzzles (avg 0.01 secs (71 Hz), max 0.02 secs).Solved 99 of 99 random puzzles (avg 0.01 secs (85 Hz), max 0.02 secs).AnalysisEach of the puzzles above was solved in less than a fifth of a second. What about really hard puzzles? Finnish mathematician Arto Inkala described his 2006 puzzle as “the most difficult sudoku-puzzle known so far” and his 2010 puzzle as “the most difficult puzzle I’ve ever created.” My program solves them in 0.01 seconds each (solve_all will be defined below):&gt;&gt;&gt; solve_all(from_file(\"hardest.txt\")[0:2], 'Inkala')8 5 . |. . 2 |4 . . 7 2 . |. . . |. . 9 . . 4 |. . . |. . . ------+------+------. . . |1 . 7 |. . 2 3 . 5 |. . . |9 . . . 4 . |. . . |. . . ------+------+------. . . |. 8 . |. 7 . . 1 7 |. . . |. . . . . . |. 3 6 |. 4 . 8 5 9 |6 1 2 |4 3 7 7 2 3 |8 5 4 |1 6 9 1 6 4 |3 7 9 |5 2 8 ------+------+------9 8 6 |1 4 7 |3 5 2 3 7 5 |2 6 8 |9 1 4 2 4 1 |5 9 3 |7 8 6 ------+------+------4 3 2 |9 8 1 |6 7 5 6 1 7 |4 2 5 |8 9 3 5 9 8 |7 3 6 |2 4 1 (0.01 seconds). . 5 |3 . . |. . . 8 . . |. . . |. 2 . . 7 . |. 1 . |5 . . ------+------+------4 . . |. . 5 |3 . . . 1 . |. 7 . |. . 6 . . 3 |2 . . |. 8 . ------+------+------. 6 . |5 . . |. . 9 . . 4 |. . . |. 3 . . . . |. . 9 |7 . . 1 4 5 |3 2 7 |6 9 8 8 3 9 |6 5 4 |1 2 7 6 7 2 |9 1 8 |5 4 3 ------+------+------4 9 6 |1 8 5 |3 7 2 2 1 8 |4 7 3 |9 5 6 7 5 3 |2 9 6 |4 8 1 ------+------+------3 6 7 |5 4 2 |8 1 9 9 8 4 |7 6 1 |2 3 5 5 2 1 |8 3 9 |7 6 4 (0.01 seconds)Solved 2 of 2 Inkala puzzles (avg 0.01 secs (99 Hz), max 0.01 secs).I guess if I want a really hard puzzle I’ll have to make it myself. I don’t know how to make hard puzzles, so I generated a million random puzzles. My algorithm for making a random puzzle is simple: first, randomly shuffle the order of the squares. One by one, fill in each square with a random digit, respecting the possible digit choices. If a contradiction is reached, start over. If we fill at least 17 squares with at least 8 different digits then we are done. (Note: with less than 17 squares filled in or less than 8 different digits it is known that there will be duplicate solutions. Thanks to Olivier Grégoire for the fine suggestion about 8 different digits.) Even with these checks, my random puzzles are not guaranteed to have one unique solution. Many have multiple solutions, and a few (about 0.2%) have no solution. Puzzles that appear in books and newspapers always have one unique solution.The average time to solve a random puzzle is 0.01 seconds, and more than 99.95% took less than 0.1 seconds, but a few took much longer:                    0.032%        (1 in 3,000)        took more than 0.1 seconds                            0.014%        (1 in 7,000)        took more than 1 second                    0.003%        (1 in 30,000)        took more than 10 seconds                    0.0001%        (1 in 1,000,000)        took more than 100 seconds            Here are the times in seconds for the 139 out of a million puzzles that took more than a second, sorted, on linear and log scales:It is hard to draw conclusions from this. Is the uptick in the last few values significant? If I generated 10 million puzzles, would one take 1000 seconds? Here’s the hardest (for my program) of the million random puzzles:&gt;&gt;&gt; hard1  = '.....6....59.....82....8....45........3........6..3.54...325..6..................'&gt;&gt;&gt; solve_all([hard1]). . . |. . 6 |. . . . 5 9 |. . . |. . 8 2 . . |. . 8 |. . . ------+------+------. 4 5 |. . . |. . . . . 3 |. . . |. . . . . 6 |. . 3 |. 5 4 ------+------+------. . . |3 2 5 |. . 6 . . . |. . . |. . . . . . |. . . |. . . 4 3 8 |7 9 6 |2 1 5 6 5 9 |1 3 2 |4 7 8 2 7 1 |4 5 8 |6 9 3 ------+------+------8 4 5 |2 1 9 |3 6 7 7 1 3 |5 6 4 |8 2 9 9 2 6 |8 7 3 |1 5 4 ------+------+------1 9 4 |3 2 5 |7 8 6 3 6 2 |9 8 7 |5 4 1 5 8 7 |6 4 1 |9 3 2 (188.79 seconds)Unfortunately, this is not a true Sudoku puzzle because it has multiple solutions. (It was generated before I incorporated Olivier Grégoire’s suggestion about checking for 8 digits, so note that any solution to this puzzle leads to another solution where the 1s and 7s are swapped.) But is this an intrinsically hard puzzle? Or is the difficulty an artifact of the particular variable- and value-ordering scheme used by my search routine? To test I randomized the value ordering (I changed for d in values[s] in the last line of search to be for d in shuffled(values[s]) and implemented shuffled using random.shuffle). The results were starkly bimodal: in 27 out of 30 trials the puzzle took less than 0.02 seconds, while each of the other 3 trials took just about 190 seconds (about 10,000 times longer). There are multiple solutions to this puzzle, and the randomized search found 13 different solutions. My guess is that somewhere early in the search there is a sequence of squares (probably two) such that if we choose the exact wrong combination of values to fill the squares, it takes about 190 seconds to discover that there is a contradiction. But if we make any other choice, we very quickly either find a solution or find a contradiction and move on to another choice. So the speed of the algorithm is determined by whether it can avoid the deadly combination of value choices.Randomization works most of the time (27 out of 30), but perhaps we could do even better by considering a better value ordering (one popular heuristic is least-constraining value, which chooses first the value that imposes the fewest constraints on peers), or by trying a smarter variable ordering.More experimentation would be needed before I could give a good characterization of the hard puzzles. I decided to experiment on another million random puzzles, this time keeping statistics on the mean, 50th (median), 90th and 99th percentiles, maximum and standard deviation of run times. The results were similar, except this time I got two puzzles that took over 100 seconds, and one took quite a bit longer: 1439 seconds. It turns out this puzzle is one of the 0.2% that has no solution, so maybe it doesn’t count. But the main message is that the mean and median stay about the same even as we sample more, but the maximum keeps going up–dramatically. The standard deviation edges up too, but mostly because of the very few very long times that are way out beyond the 99th percentile. This is a heavy-tailed distribution, not a normal one.For comparison, the tables below give the statistics for puzzle-solving run times on the left, and for samples from a normal (Gaussian) distribution with mean 0.014 and standard deviation 1.4794 on the right. Note that with a million samples, the max of the Gaussian is 5 standard deviations above the mean (roughly what you’d expect from a Gaussian), while the maximum puzzle run time is 1000 standard deviations above the mean.Samples of Puzzle Run Time            N      mean      50%      90%      99%      max      std. dev                  10      0.012      0.01      0.01      0.01      0.02      0.0034              100      0.011      0.01      0.01      0.02      0.02      0.0029              1,000      0.011      0.01      0.01      0.02      0.02      0.0025              10,000      0.011      0.01      0.01      0.02      0.68      0.0093              100,000      0.012      0.01      0.01      0.02      29.07      0.1336              1,000,000      0.014      0.01      0.01      0.02      1439.81      1.4794      Samples of N(0.014, 1.4794)            N      mean      50%      90%      99%      max      std. dev                  10      0.312      1.24      1.62      1.62      1.62      1.4061              100      0.278      0.18      2.33      4.15      4.15      1.4985              1,000      0.072      0.10      1.94      3.38      6.18      1.4973              10,000      0.025      0.05      1.94      3.45      6.18      1.4983              100,000      0.017      0.02      1.91      3.47      7.07      1.4820              1,000,000      0.014      0.01      1.91      3.46      7.80      1.4802      Here is the impossible puzzle that took 1439 seconds:. . . |. . 5 |. 8 . . . . |6 . 1 |. 4 3 . . . |. . . |. . . ------+------+------. 1 . |5 . . |. . . . . . |1 . 6 |. . . 3 . . |. . . |. . 5 ------+------+------5 3 . |. . . |. 6 1 . . . |. . . |. . 4 . . . |. . . |. . .

As computer security expert Ben Laurie has stated, Sudoku is “a denial of service attack on human intellect”. Several people I know (including my wife) were infected by the virus, and I thought maybe this would demonstrate that they didn’t need to spend any more time on Sudoku. It didn’t work for my friends (although my wife has since independently kicked the habit without my help), but at least one stranger wrote and said this page worked for him, so I’ve made the world more productive. And perhaps along the way I’ve taught something about Python, constraint propagation, and search.TranslationsThis code has been reimplemented by several people in several languages:  C++ by Pau Fernandez  C# with LINQ version by Richard Birkby  Clojure version by Justin Kramer  Erlang version by Andreas Pauley  Haskell version by Emmanuel Delaborde  Java version by Johannes Brodwall  Javascript version by Brendan Eich  Javascript version by Pankaj Kumar  Ruby version by Luddite Geek  Ruby version by Martin-Louis Bright",

Welcome to Ghost, it’s great to have you :)We know that first impressions are important, so we’ve populated your new site with some initial Getting Started posts that will help you get familiar with everything in no time. This is the first one!There are a few things that you should know up-front:  Ghost is designed for ambitious, professional publishers who want to actively build a business around their content. That’s who it works best for. If you’re using Ghost for some other purpose, that’s fine too - but it might not be the best choice for you.  The entire platform can be modified and customized to suit your needs, which is very powerful, but doing so does require some knowledge of code. Ghost is not necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a simple personal blog.  For the best experience we recommend downloading the Ghost Desktop App for your computer, which is the best way to access your Ghost site on a desktop device.Ghost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost Foundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our Ghost(Pro) service, and every penny we make is re-invested into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern journalism.The main thing you’ll want to read about next is probably: the Ghost editor.Once you’re done reading, you can simply delete the default Ghost user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts!",

        "content": "Ghost uses a language called Markdown to format text.When you go to edit a post and see special characters and colours intertwined between the words, those are Markdown shortcuts which tell Ghost what to do with the words in your document. The biggest benefit of Markdown is that you can quickly apply formatting as you type, without needing to pause.At the bottom of the editor, you'll find a toolbar with basic formatting options to help you get started as easily as possible. You'll also notice that there's a ? icon, which contains more advanced shortcuts.For now, though, let's run you through some of the basics. You'll want to make sure you're editing this post in order to see all the Markdown we've used.Formatting textThe most common shortcuts are of course, bold text, italic text, and hyperlinks. These generally make up the bulk of any document. You can type the characters out, but you can also use keyboard shortcuts.CMD/Ctrl + B for BoldCMD/Ctrl + I for ItalicCMD/Ctrl + K for a LinkCMD/Ctrl + H for a Heading (Press multiple times for h2/h3/h4/etc)With just a couple of extra characters here and there, you're well on your way to creating a beautifully formatted story.Inserting imagesImages in Markdown look just the same as links, except they're prefixed with an exclamation mark, like this:![Image description](/path/to/image.jpg)Most Markdown editors don't make you type this out, though. In Ghost you can click on the image icon in the toolbar at the bottom of the editor, or you can just click and drag an image from your desktop directly into the editor. Both will upload the image for you and generate the appropriate Markdown.Important Note: Ghost does not currently have automatic image resizing, so it's always a good idea to make sure your images aren't gigantic files before uploading them to Ghost.Making listsLists in HTML are a formatting nightmare, but in Markdown they become an absolute breeze with just a couple of characters and a bit of smart automation. For numbered lists, just write out the numbers. For bullet lists, just use * or - or +. Like this:Crack the eggs over a bowlWhisk them togetherMake an omelleteorRemember to buy milkFeed the catCome up with idea for next storyAdding quotesWhen you want to pull out a particularly good except in the middle of a piece, you can use &gt; at the beginning of a paragraph to turn it into a Blockquote. You might've seen this formatting before in email clients.A well placed quote guides a reader through a story, helping them to understand the most important points being madeAll themes handles blockquotes slightly differently. Sometimes they'll look better kept shorter, while other times you can quote fairly hefty amounts of text and get away with it. Generally, the safest option is to use blockquotes sparingly.Dividing things upIf you're writing a piece in parts and you just feel like you need to divide a couple of sections distinctly from each other, a horizontal rule might be just what you need. Dropping --- on a new line will create a sleak divider, anywhere you want it.This should get you going with the vast majority of what you need to do in the editor, but if you're still curious about more advanced tips then check out the Advanced Markdown Guide - or if you'd rather learn about how Ghost taxononomies work, we've got a overview of how to use Ghost tags.",

        "content": "Ghost has a single, powerful organisational taxonomy, called tags.It doesn't matter whether you want to call them categories, tags, boxes, or anything else. You can think of Ghost tags a lot like Gmail labels. By tagging posts with one or more keyword, you can organise articles into buckets of related content.Basic taggingWhen you write a post, you can assign tags to help differentiate between categories of content. For example, you might tag some posts with News and other posts with Cycling, which would create two distinct categories of content listed on /tag/news/ and /tag/cycling/, respectively.If you tag a post with both News and Cycling - then it appears in both sections.Tag archives are like dedicated home-pages for each category of content that you have. They have their own pages, their own RSS feeds, and can support their own cover images and meta data.The primary tagInside the Ghost editor, you can drag and drop tags into a specific order. The first tag in the list is always given the most importance, and some themes will only display the primary tag (the first tag in the list) by default. So you can add the most important tag which you want to show up in your theme, but also add a bunch of related tags which are less important.News, Cycling, Bart Stevens, Extreme SportsIn this example, News is the primary tag which will be displayed by the theme, but the post will also still receive all the other tags, and show up in their respective archives.Private tagsSometimes you may want to assign a post a specific tag, but you don't necessarily want that tag appearing in the theme or creating an archive page. In Ghost, hashtags are private and can be used for special styling.For example, if you sometimes publish posts with video content - you might want your theme to adapt and get rid of the sidebar for these posts, to give more space for an embedded video to fill the screen. In this case, you could use private tags to tell your theme what to do.News, Cycling, #videoHere, the theme would assign the post publicly displayed tags of News, and Cycling - but it would also keep a private record of the post being tagged with #video.In your theme, you could then look for private tags conditionally and give them special formatting:{{#post}}    {{#has tag=&quot;#video&quot;}}        ...markup for a nice big video post layout...    {{else}}        ...regular markup for a post...    {{/has}}{{/post}}You can find documentation for theme development techniques like this and many more over on Ghost's extensive theme documentation.",

Authors can write posts, edit their own posts, and publish their own posts. Authors are trusted users. If you don't trust users to be allowed to publish their own posts, you shouldn't invite them to Ghost admin.EditorsEditors are the 2nd user level in Ghost. Editors can do everything that an Author can do, but they can also edit and publish the posts of others - as well as their own. Editors can also invite new authors to the site.AdministratorsThe top user level in Ghost is Administrator. Again, administrators can do everything that Authors and Editors can do, but they can also edit all site settings and data, not just content. Additionally, administrators have full access to invite, manage or remove any other user of the site.The OwnerThere is only ever one owner of a Ghost site. The owner is a special user which has all the same permissions as an Administrator, but with two exceptions: The Owner can never be deleted. And in some circumstances the owner will have access to additional special settings if applicable — for example, billing details, if using Ghost(Pro).It's a good idea to ask all of your users to fill out their user profiles, including bio and social links.

Inline code is formatted by wrapping any word or words in back-ticks, like this. Larger snippets of code can be displayed across multiple lines using triple back ticks:.my-link {    text-decoration: underline;}If you want to get really fancy, you can even add syntax highlighting using Prism.js.Full bleed imagesOne neat trick which you can use in Markdown to distinguish between different types of images is to add a #hash value to the end of the source URL, and then target images containing the hash with special styling. For example:which is styled with...img[src$=&quot;#full&quot;] {    max-width: 100vw;}This creates full-bleed images in the Casper theme, which stretch beyond their usual boundaries right up to the edge of the window. Every theme handles these types of things slightly differently, but it's a great trick to play with if you want to have a variety of image sizes and styles.Reference listsThe quick brown fox, jumped over the lazy dog.Another way to insert links in markdown is using reference lists. You might want to use this style of linking to cite reference material in a Wikipedia-style. All of the links are listed at the end of the document, so you can maintain full separation between content and its source or reference.Creating footnotesThe quick brown fox[1] jumped over the lazy dog[2].Footnotes are a great way to add additional contextual details when appropriate. Ghost will automatically add footnote content to the very end of your post.Full HTMLPerhaps the best part of Markdown is that you're never limited to just Markdown. You can write HTML directly in the Ghost editor and it will just work as HTML usually does. No limits! Here's a standard YouTube embed code as an example:Foxes are red ↩︎Dogs are usually not red ↩︎",

Unable to sleep after an urgent phone call from the office the first morning, he walked out to the pier to clear his head. A small boat with just one fisherman had docked, and inside the boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish.“How long did it take you to catch them?” the American asked.“Only a little while,” the Mexican replied in surprisingly good English.“Why don’t you stay out longer and catch more fish?” the American then asked.“I have enough to support my family and give a few to friends,” the Mexican said as he unloaded them into a basket.“But… What do you do with the rest of your time?”The Mexican looked up and smiled. “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take a siesta with my wife, Julia, and stroll into the village each evening, where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos. I have a full and busy life, señor.”The American laughed and stood tall. “Sir, I’m a Harvard M.B.A. and can help you. You should spend more time fishing, and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. In no time, you could buy several boats with the increased haul. Eventually, you would have a fleet of fishing boats.”He continued, “Instead of selling your catch to a middleman, you would sell directly to the consumers, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village, of course, and move to Mexico City, then to Los Angeles, and eventually to New York City, where you could run your expanded enterprise with proper management.The Mexican fisherman asked, “But, señor, how long will all this take?”To which the American replied, “15-20 years, 25 tops.”“But what then, señor?”The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part. When the time is right, you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich. You would make millions.”“Millions señor? Then what?”“Then you would retire and move to a small coastal fishing village, where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take a siesta with your wife, and stroll in to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.”Adapted from the “Anekdote zur Senkung der Arbeitsmoral” by Heinrich BöllAn influential German write and Nobel Prize for Literature in 1972.",

Because we have more specific typographic needs for code, we’ll specify Consolas and Monaco ahead of the browser-defined monospace font.Code blocks can also be inserted with the highlight tag as below:        {% highlight language-x %}    # some code    {% endhighlight %}    More information about code highlighting in jekyll can be found  in Jekyll documentation.These area a couple of examples showing the resulting highlighted code:/* css code sample */#container {    float: left;    margin: 0 -240px 0 0;    width: 100%;}12345678910111213// javascript code sample$.ajax({  type: 'POST',  url: 'backend.php',  data: \"q=\"+myform.serialize(),  success: function(data){    // on success use return data here  },  error: function(xhr, type, exception) {    // if ajax fails display error alert    alert(\"ajax error response type \"+type);  }});Now you can also use highlight.js.For more on how to use it and on the available styles check theirdemo anddocumentation pages.// Swift code sampleimport Foundation@objc class Person: Entity {  var name: String!  var age:  Int!  init(name: String, age: Int) {    /* /* ... */ */  }  // Return a descriptive string for this person  func description(offset: Int = 0) -> String {    return \"\\(name) is \\(age + offset) years old\"  }}BlockquotesLet’s keep it simple.

        "content": "As I engage in the so-called “bull sessions” around and about the school, I too often find that most college men have a misconception of the purpose of education. Most of the “brethren” think that education should equip them with the proper instruments of exploitation so that they can forever trample over the masses. Still others think that education should furnish them with noble ends rather than means to an end.It seems to me that education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the ligitimate goals of his life.Education must also train one for quick, resolute and effective thinking. To think incisively and to think for one’s self is very difficult. We are prone to let our mental life become invaded by legions of half truths, prejudices, and propaganda. At this point, I often wonder whether or not education is fulfilling its purpose. A great majority of the so-called educated people do not think logically and scientifically. Even the press, the classroom, the platform, and the pulpit in many instances do not give us objective and unbiased truths. To save man from the morass of propaganda, in my opinion, is one of the chief aims of education. Education must enable one to sift and weigh evidence, to discern the true from the false, the real from the unreal, and the facts from the fiction.The function of education, therefore, is to teach one to think intensively and to think critically. But education which stops with efficiency may prove the greatest menace to society. The most dangerous criminal may be the man gifted with reason, but with no morals.The late Eugene Talmadge, in my opinion, possessed one of the better minds of Georgia, or even America. Moreover, he wore the Phi Beta Kappa key. By all measuring rods, Mr. Talmadge could think critically and intensively; yet he contends that I am an inferior being. Are those the types of men we call educated?We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character–that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living.If we are not careful, our colleges will produce a group of close-minded, unscientific, illogical propagandists, consumed with immoral acts. Be careful, “brethren!” Be careful, teachers!",

        "content": "I had this story from one who had no business to tell it to me, or to any other. I may credit the seductive influence of an old vintage upon the narrator for the beginning of it, and my own skeptical incredulity during the days that followed for the balance of the strange tale.When my convivial host discovered that he had told me so much, and that I was prone to doubtfulness, his foolish pride assumed the task the old vintage had commenced, and so he unearthed written evidence in the form of musty manuscript, and dry official records of the British Colonial Office to support many of the salient features of his remarkable narrative.I do not say the story is true, for I did not witness the happenings which it portrays, but the fact that in the telling of it to you I have taken fictitious names for the principal characters quite sufficiently evidences the sincerity of my own belief that it MAY be true.The yellow, mildewed pages of the diary of a man long dead, and the records of the Colonial Office dovetail perfectly with the narrative of my convivial host, and so I give you the story as I painstakingly pieced it out from these several various agencies.If you do not find it credible you will at least be as one with me in acknowledging that it is unique, remarkable, and interesting.From the records of the Colonial Office and from the dead man’s diary we learn that a certain young English nobleman, whom we shall call John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, was commissioned to make a peculiarly delicate investigation of conditions in a British West Coast African Colony from whose simple native inhabitants another European power was known to be recruiting soldiers for its native army, which it used solely for the forcible collection of rubber and ivory from the savage tribes along the Congo and the Aruwimi. The natives of the British Colony complained that many of their young men were enticed away through the medium of fair and glowing promises, but that few if any ever returned to their families.The Englishmen in Africa went even further, saying that these poor blacks were held in virtual slavery, since after their terms of enlistment expired their ignorance was imposed upon by their white officers, and they were told that they had yet several years to serve.And so the Colonial Office appointed John Clayton to a new post in British West Africa, but his confidential instructions centered on a thorough investigation of the unfair treatment of black British subjects by the officers of a friendly European power. Why he was sent, is, however, of little moment to this story, for he never made an investigation, nor, in fact, did he ever reach his destination.Clayton was the type of Englishman that one likes best to associate with the noblest monuments of historic achievement upon a thousand victorious battlefields–a strong, virile man –mentally, morally, and physically.In stature he was above the average height; his eyes were gray, his features regular and strong; his carriage that of perfect, robust health influenced by his years of army training.Political ambition had caused him to seek transference from the army to the Colonial Office and so we find him, still young, entrusted with a delicate and important commission in the service of the Queen.When he received this appointment he was both elated and appalled. The preferment seemed to him in the nature of a well-merited reward for painstaking and intelligent service, and as a stepping stone to posts of greater importance and responsibility; but, on the other hand, he had been married to the Hon. Alice Rutherford for scarce a three months, and it was the thought of taking this fair young girl into the dangers and isolation of tropical Africa that appalled him.For her sake he would have refused the appointment, but she would not have it so. Instead she insisted that he accept, and, indeed, take her with him.There were mothers and brothers and sisters, and aunts and cousins to express various opinions on the subject, but as to what they severally advised history is silent.We know only that on a bright May morning in 1888, John, Lord Greystoke, and Lady Alice sailed from Dover on their way to Africa.A month later they arrived at Freetown where they chartered a small sailing vessel, the Fuwalda, which was to bear them to their final destination.And here John, Lord Greystoke, and Lady Alice, his wife, vanished from the eyes and from the knowledge of men.Two months after they weighed anchor and cleared from the port of Freetown a half dozen British war vessels were scouring the south Atlantic for trace of them or their little vessel, and it was almost immediately that the wreckage was found upon the shores of St. Helena which convinced the world that the Fuwalda had gone down with all on board, and hence the search was stopped ere it had scarce begun; though hope lingered in longing hearts for many years.The Fuwalda, a barkentine of about one hundred tons, was a vessel of the type often seen in coastwise trade in the far southern Atlantic, their crews composed of the offscourings of the sea–unhanged murderers and cutthroats of every race and every nation.The Fuwalda was no exception to the rule. Her officers were swarthy bullies, hating and hated by their crew. The captain, while a competent seaman, was a brute in his treatment of his men. He knew, or at least he used, but two arguments in his dealings with them–a belaying pin and a revolver–nor is it likely that the motley aggregation he signed would have understood aught else.So it was that from the second day out from Freetown John Clayton and his young wife witnessed scenes upon the deck of the Fuwalda such as they had believed were never enacted outside the covers of printed stories of the sea.It was on the morning of the second day that the first link was forged in what was destined to form a chain of circumstances ending in a life for one then unborn such as has never been paralleled in the history of man.Two sailors were washing down the decks of the Fuwalda, the first mate was on duty, and the captain had stopped to speak with John Clayton and Lady Alice.The men were working backwards toward the little party who were facing away from the sailors. Closer and closer they came, until one of them was directly behind the captain. In another moment he would have passed by and this strange narrative would never have been recorded.But just that instant the officer turned to leave Lord and Lady Greystoke, and, as he did so, tripped against the sailor and sprawled headlong upon the deck, overturning the water- pail so that he was drenched in its dirty contents.For an instant the scene was ludicrous; but only for an instant. With a volley of awful oaths, his face suffused with the scarlet of mortification and rage, the captain regained his feet, and with a terrific blow felled the sailor to the deck.The man was small and rather old, so that the brutality of the act was thus accentuated. The other seaman, however, was neither old nor small–a huge bear of a man, with fierce black mustachios, and a great bull neck set between massive shoulders.As he saw his mate go down he crouched, and, with a low snarl, sprang upon the captain crushing him to his knees with a single mighty blow.From scarlet the officer’s face went white, for this was mutiny; and mutiny he had met and subdued before in his brutal career. Without waiting to rise he whipped a revolver from his pocket, firing point blank at the great mountain of muscle towering before him; but, quick as he was, John Clayton was almost as quick, so that the bullet which was intended for the sailor’s heart lodged in the sailor’s leg instead, for Lord Greystoke had struck down the captain’s arm as he had seen the weapon flash in the sun.Words passed between Clayton and the captain, the former making it plain that he was disgusted with the brutality displayed toward the crew, nor would he countenance anything further of the kind while he and Lady Greystoke remained passengers.The captain was on the point of making an angry reply, but, thinking better of it, turned on his heel and black and scowling, strode aft.He did not care to antagonize an English official, for the Queen’s mighty arm wielded a punitive instrument which he could appreciate, and which he feared–England’s far-reaching navy.The two sailors picked themselves up, the older man assisting his wounded comrade to rise. The big fellow, who was known among his mates as Black Michael, tried his leg gingerly, and, finding that it bore his weight, turned to Clayton with a word of gruff thanks.Though the fellow’s tone was surly, his words were evidently well meant. Ere he had scarce finished his little speech he had turned and was limping off toward the forecastle with the very apparent intention of forestalling any further conversation.They did not see him again for several days, nor did the captain accord them more than the surliest of grunts when he was forced to speak to them.They took their meals in his cabin, as they had before the unfortunate occurrence; but the captain was careful to see that his duties never permitted him to eat at the same time.The other officers were coarse, illiterate fellows, but little above the villainous crew they bullied, and were only too glad to avoid social intercourse with the polished English noble and his lady, so that the Claytons were left very much to themselves.This in itself accorded perfectly with their desires, but it also rather isolated them from the life of the little ship so that they were unable to keep in touch with the daily happenings which were to culminate so soon in bloody tragedy.",

        "content": "One thing was certain, that the white kitten had had nothing to do with it:— it was the black kitten’s fault entirely. For the white kitten had been having its face washed by the old cat for the last quarter of an hour (and bearing it pretty well, considering); so you see that it couldn’t have had any hand in the mischief.The way Dinah washed her children’s faces was this: first she held the poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and just now, as I said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was lying quite still and trying to purr — no doubt feeling that it was all meant for its good.But the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon, and so, while Alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great arm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted Alice had been trying to wind up, and had been rolling it up and down till it had all come undone again; and there it was, spread over the hearth-rug, all knots and tangles, with the kitten running after its own tail in the middle.‘Oh, you wicked little thing!’ cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace. ‘Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners! You ought, Dinah, you know you ought!’ she added, looking reproachfully at the old cat, and speaking in as cross a voice as she could manage — and then she scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted with her, and began winding up the ball again. But she didn’t get on very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and sometimes to herself. Kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it might. ‘Do you know what to-morrow is, Kitty?’ Alice began. ‘You’d have guessed if you’d been up in the window with me — only Dinah was making you tidy, so you couldn’t. I was watching the boys getting in sticks for the bonfire — and it wants plenty of sticks, Kitty! Only it got so cold, and it snowed so, they had to leave off. Never mind, Kitty, we’ll go and see the bonfire to-morrow.’ Here Alice wound two or three turns of the worsted round the kitten’s neck, just to see how it would look: this led to a scramble, in which the ball rolled down upon the floor, and yards and yards of it got unwound again.‘Do you know, I was so angry, Kitty,’ Alice went on as soon as they were comfortably settled again, ‘when I saw all the mischief you had been doing, I was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into the snow! And you’d have deserved it, you little mischievous darling! What have you got to say for yourself? Now don’t interrupt me!’ she went on, holding up one finger. ‘I’m going to tell you all your faults. Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this morning. Now you can’t deny it, Kitty: I heard you! What’s that you say?’ (pretending that the kitten was speaking.) ‘Her paw went into your eye? Well, that’s your fault, for keeping your eyes open — if you’d shut them tight up, it wouldn’t have happened. Now don’t make any more excuses, but listen! Number two: you pulled Snowdrop away by the tail just as I had put down the saucer of milk before her! What, you were thirsty, were you? How do you know she wasn’t thirsty too? Now for number three: you unwound every bit of the worsted while I wasn’t looking!‘That’s three faults, Kitty, and you’ve not been punished for any of them yet. You know I’m saving up all your punishments for Wednesday week — Suppose they had saved up all my punishments!’ she went on, talking more to herself than the kitten. ‘What would they do at the end of a year? I should be sent to prison, I suppose, when the day came. Or — let me see — suppose each punishment was to be going without a dinner: then, when the miserable day came, I should have to go without fifty dinners at once! Well, I shouldn’t mind that much! I’d far rather go without them than eat them! ‘Do you hear the snow against the window-panes, Kitty? How nice and soft it sounds! Just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside. I wonder if the snow loves the trees and fields, that it kisses them so gently? And then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt; and perhaps it says, “Go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes again.” And when they wake up in the summer, Kitty, they dress themselves all in green, and dance about — whenever the wind blows — oh, that’s very pretty!’ cried Alice, dropping the ball of worsted to clap her hands. ‘And I do so wish it was true! I’m sure the woods look sleepy in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown. ‘Kitty, can you play chess? Now, don’t smile, my dear, I’m asking it seriously. Because, when we were playing just now, you watched just as if you understood it: and when I said “Check!” you purred! Well, it was a nice check, Kitty, and really I might have won, if it hadn’t been for that nasty Knight, that came wiggling down among my pieces. Kitty, dear, let’s pretend —’ And here I wish I could tell you half the things Alice used to say, beginning with her favourite phrase ‘Let’s pretend.’ She had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day before — all because Alice had begun with ‘Let’s pretend we’re kings and queens;’ and her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued that they couldn’t, because there were only two of them, and Alice had been reduced at last to say, ‘Well, you can be one of them then, and I’ll be all the rest.’ And once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in her ear, ‘Nurse! Do let’s pretend that I’m a hungry hyaena, and you’re a bone.’ But this is taking us away from Alice’s speech to the kitten. ‘Let’s pretend that you’re the Red Queen, Kitty! Do you know, I think if you sat up and folded your arms, you’d look exactly like her. Now do try, there’s a dear!’ And Alice got the Red Queen off the table, and set it up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing didn’t succeed, principally, Alice said, because the kitten wouldn’t fold its arms properly. So, to punish it, she held it up to the Looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was —‘and if you’re not good directly,’ she added, ‘I’ll put you through into Looking-glass House. How would you like that?’‘Now, if you’ll only attend, Kitty, and not talk so much, I’ll tell you all my ideas about Looking-glass House. First, there’s the room you can see through the glass — that’s just the same as our drawing room, only the things go the other way. I can see all of it when I get upon a chair — all but the bit behind the fireplace. Oh! I do so wish I could see that bit! I want so much to know whether they’ve a fire in the winter: you never can tell, you know, unless our fire smokes, and then smoke comes up in that room too — but that may be only pretence, just to make it look as if they had a fire. Well then, the books are something like our books, only the words go the wrong way; I know that, because I’ve held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold up one in the other room. ‘How would you like to live in Looking-glass House, Kitty? I wonder if they’d give you milk in there? Perhaps Looking-glass milk isn’t good to drink — But oh, Kitty! now we come to the passage. You can just see a little peep of the passage in Looking-glass House, if you leave the door of our drawing-room wide open: and it’s very like our passage as far as you can see, only you know it may be quite different on beyond. Oh, Kitty! how nice it would be if we could only get through into Looking-glass House! I’m sure it’s got, oh! such beautiful things in it! Let’s pretend there’s a way of getting through into it, somehow, Kitty. Let’s pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze, so that we can get through. Why, it’s turning into a sort of mist now, I declare! It’ll be easy enough to get through —’ She was up on the chimney-piece while she said this, though she hardly knew how she had got there. And certainly the glass was beginning to melt away, just like a bright silvery mist.In another moment Alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly down into the Looking-glass room. The very first thing she did was to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite pleased to find that there was a real one, blazing away as brightly as the one she had left behind. ‘So I shall be as warm here as I was in the old room,’ thought Alice: ‘warmer, in fact, because there’ll be no one here to scold me away from the fire. Oh, what fun it’ll be, when they see me through the glass in here, and can’t get at me!’Then she began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from the old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest was as different as possible. For instance, the pictures on the wall next the fire seemed to be all alive, and the very clock on the chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the Looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and grinned at her.‘They don’t keep this room so tidy as the other,’ Alice thought to herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among the cinders: but in another moment, with a little ‘Oh!’ of surprise, she was down on her hands and knees watching them. The chessmen were walking about, two and two!‘Here are the Red King and the Red Queen,’ Alice said (in a whisper, for fear of frightening them), ‘and there are the White King and the White Queen sitting on the edge of the shovel — and here are two castles walking arm in arm — I don’t think they can hear me,’ she went on, as she put her head closer down, ‘and I’m nearly sure they can’t see me. I feel somehow as if I were invisible —’ Here something began squeaking on the table behind Alice, and made her turn her head just in time to see one of the White Pawns roll over and begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would happen next.‘It is the voice of my child!’ the White Queen cried out as she rushed past the King, so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders. ‘My precious Lily! My imperial kitten!’ and she began scrambling wildly up the side of the fender. ‘Imperial fiddlestick!’ said the King, rubbing his nose, which had been hurt by the fall. He had a right to be a little annoyed with the Queen, for he was covered with ashes from head to foot. Alice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little Lily was nearly screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the Queen and set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter.The Queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing but hug the little Lily in silence. As soon as she had recovered her breath a little, she called out to the White King, who was sitting sulkily among the ashes, ‘Mind the volcano!’‘What volcano?’ said the King, looking up anxiously into the fire, as if he thought that was the most likely place to find one. ‘Blew — me — up,’ panted the Queen, who was still a little out of breath. ‘Mind you come up — the regular way — don’t get blown up!’ Alice watched the White King as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar, till at last she said, ‘Why, you’ll be hours and hours getting to the table, at that rate. I’d far better help you, hadn’t I?’ But the King took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could neither hear her nor see her.So Alice picked him up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly than she had lifted the Queen, that she mightn’t take his breath away: but, before she put him on the table, she thought she might as well dust him a little, he was so covered with ashes.She said afterwards that she had never seen in all her life such a face as the King made, when he found himself held in the air by an invisible hand, and being dusted: he was far too much astonished to cry out, but his eyes and his mouth went on getting larger and larger, and rounder and rounder, till her hand shook so with laughing that she nearly let him drop upon the floor.‘Oh! please don’t make such faces, my dear!’ she cried out, quite forgetting that the King couldn’t hear her. ‘You make me laugh so that I can hardly hold you! And don’t keep your mouth so wide open! All the ashes will get into it — there, now I think you’re tidy enough!’ she added, as she smoothed his hair, and set him upon the table near the Queen. The King immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still: and Alice was a little alarmed at what she had done, and went round the room to see if she could find any water to throw over him. However, she could find nothing but a bottle of ink, and when she got back with it she found he had recovered, and he and the Queen were talking together in a frightened whisper — so low, that Alice could hardly hear what they said.The King was saying, ‘I assure, you my dear, I turned cold to the very ends of my whiskers!’To which the Queen replied, ‘You haven’t got any whiskers.’‘The horror of that moment,’ the King went on, ‘I shall never, never forget!’ ‘You will, though,’ the Queen said, ‘if you don’t make a memorandum of it.’ Alice looked on with great interest as the King took an enormous memorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing. A sudden thought struck her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came some way over his shoulder, and began writing for him.The poor King looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil for some time without saying anything; but Alice was too strong for him, and at last he panted out, ‘My dear! I really must get a thinner pencil. I can’t manage this one a bit; it writes all manner of things that I don’t intend —’‘What manner of things?’ said the Queen, looking over the book (in which Alice had put ‘the White Knight is sliding down the poker. He balances very badly’) ‘That’s not a memorandum of your feelings!’",

Oh dear! I shall be late!’ (when she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was labelled ‘ORANGE MARMALADE’, but to her great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it.‘Well!’ thought Alice to herself, ‘after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!’ (Which was very likely true.)Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end! ‘I wonder how many miles I’ve fallen by this time?’ she said aloud. ‘I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think—’ (for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) ‘—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?’ (Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.)Presently she began again. ‘I wonder if I shall fall right through the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—’ (she was rather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all the right word) ‘—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealand or Australia?’ (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancy curtseying as you’re falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?) ‘And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think me for asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.’Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. ‘Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!’ (Dinah was the cat.) ‘I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?’ And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, ‘Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?’ and sometimes, ‘Do bats eat cats?’ for, you see, as she couldn’t answer either question, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, ‘Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?’ when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, ‘Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting!’ She was close behind it when she turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them.However, on the second time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head though the doorway; ‘and even if my head would go through,’ thought poor Alice, ‘it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only know how to begin.’ For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a little bottle on it, (‘which certainly was not here before,’ said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words ‘DRINK ME’ beautifully printed on it in large letters.It was all very well to say ‘Drink me,’ but the wise little Alice was not going to do that in a hurry. ‘No, I’ll look first,’ she said, ‘and see whether it’s marked “poison” or not’; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked ‘poison,’ it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.However, this bottle was not marked ‘poison,’ so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.‘What a curious feeling!’ said Alice; ‘I must be shutting up like a telescope.’And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous about this; ‘for it might end, you know,’ said Alice to herself, ‘in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should be like then?’ And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing.After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.‘Come, there’s no use in crying like that!’ said Alice to herself, rather sharply; ‘I advise you to leave off this minute!’ She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. ‘But it’s no use now,’ thought poor Alice, ‘to pretend to be two people! Why, there’s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person!’Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words ‘EAT ME’ were beautifully marked in currants. ‘Well, I’ll eat it,’ said Alice, ‘and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!’She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, ‘Which way? Which way?’, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.",
